Huge Thanks to Greatstacks Youtube Channel for providing the tutorial that helped me produce the code.

Within this branch You have the three necessary files to run the application. 
Both The vanilla Javascript and React.JS have the exact same fuctionality, 
the only difference is the methods used to code both.

I did utilize create vite@latest for the Layout but it isnt necessary, you could easily
just create the files within your code editor utilizing shortcuts. 

This is another simple notes application i will be utuilizing within one of my bigger projects.
I knew i would need something similar to this with a few alterations to the code 
(referring to it being written in javascript
and I needed it written in react so I figured that this would be a great 
opportunity to learn and study both.).

Below is the Channl and video tutorial I used to assist me with this repository:
